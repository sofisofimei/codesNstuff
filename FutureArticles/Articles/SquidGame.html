<p id="headlinetext">AI advancements has gone to such incredibly improvement in the span of half a decade as any video that was seen as immensely absurd could either be real or not, recently government agencies found a disturbing video of the 2025 US President “Donald Trump” playing for the “Octupus Games” and sadly failed a challenge and was punished for it. As he was getting punished we were able to see a few notable figures in the background, like Dwayne Johnson, Barrack Obama, and Sang Jin Woo twerking in the background while laughing at Trump for losing. Netizens speculate that the recent 80% increase in tariffs has made everyone basically broke as they are unable to buy anything, therefore forcing Trump to play in the games to win the 456,000,000,000,000 trillion cash prize for winning!</p>

<p id="headlinetext">Another video was found where a man was robbing a bank when the cops arrived and telling him to drop his weapon, he proceeded to dance around while slowly moving away leaving the cops shocked in what they just let happen, however this one does have proof of being real.</p>
